# Backlog: Virtual Deck

Unplanned ideas for future work. When you pick one up, run the `brainstorming` skill to shape it into a dated design spec in this directory (`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`), then `writing-plans` to produce an implementation plan. Once shipped, record the milestone in [`../../../.planning/ROADMAP.md`](../../../.planning/ROADMAP.md).

The `999.x` IDs are carried over from the previous planning system; they're just stable labels, not a priority order.

| ID | Goal |
|------|------|
| 999.17 | Chips — poker/betting chip support |
| 999.20 | Password protection for rooms — host sets a password at room creation; PartyKit `onBeforeConnect` rejects connections without the correct password (passed in URL query string) |
| 999.21 | Kick players — host can remove a player from the room; PartyKit server closes their connection on a kick message |
| 999.27 | Physical deck gap review — structured analysis of what a real card table offers that Virtual Deck doesn't yet; produces a list of missing/improvable features |
| 999.36 | Editable zone names — players can rename spread zones and piles inline |
| 999.38 | Highlight last move — subtle visual indicator on cards/zones that were just moved; fades after a few seconds so players who blink don't miss the action |
| 999.46 | Consider adding keyboard commands, for example  Cmd-Z to undo, arrow and space to select cards, hold a key to show zone shortcuts, etc |
| 999.47 | Add multiple themes or art sets that can be chosen from the menu |
| 999.48 | Add more customizations in the popup (eg. last move highlighting) |
