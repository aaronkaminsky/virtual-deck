# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Players can see the shared table and their own private hand update in real time, with no one able to see each other's face-down cards.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — server-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (server-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-04-01 -- Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Server-first sequence — Phase 1 must prove hand masking before any hand data flows to clients
- [Roadmap]: Stable player token stored in localStorage (UUID), NOT connection.id — reconnect correctness depends on this
- [Roadmap]: ROOM-04 (reconnect-to-hand) deferred to Phase 5 — requires complete game loop to test meaningfully
- [Phase 01-server-foundation]: Card ID format: rank-suit[0] (e.g. A-s, 10-h) — unambiguous for all 52 cards including 10s
- [Phase 01-server-foundation]: Party.Server skeleton with typed stubs in party/index.ts; red phase test stubs in tests/ directory

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: PartyKit hook names (`onStart`, `onConnect`, `onMessage`, `onClose`) and `party.storage` API are MEDIUM confidence — verify at https://docs.partykit.io before writing server code (API is pre-1.0)
- [Phase 2]: Confirm `partysocket` is still the correct client package name before `npm install`
- [Phase 3]: Validate dnd-kit v6 `DragOverlay` / `useSortable` / `useDroppable` APIs before building drag layer
